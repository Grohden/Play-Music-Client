# G-Music desktop client
<b>THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL CLIENT FOR GOOGLE MUSIC</b>, you should compile and look at the code by yourself.
I'm not responsible for any problem this program may cause for you, the world, or the universe.
<br/><br/>
I've write this program just to change the windows lockscreen to the current playing album image.
<br/>
<i>Some original features are not working (like the mini-player on the desktop)</i> and i still have a lot to implement.
